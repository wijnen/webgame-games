# Example games for Python-webgame

This repository contains some example games for the [python-webgame system](https://github.com/wijnen/python-webgame/).

More documentation may follow later. If you have questions, please submit and issue or send me an [email](mailto:wijnen@debian.org).

## (Some of?) the games and what can be seen in them

  - tictactoe: The "hello world" game. Very simple, to demonstrate how the system works. Use this as a reference for how to use the system.
  - zoo: The card game "Frank's Zoo". It uses the old (unfriendly) UI method. Don't define a UI like this if you write a game.
  - jolly: The card game "Jolly and Roger". This game demonstrates how 2-D and 3-D interfaces are implemented side by side.
  - vogelbeest: An "action" game. This game demonstrates how to make a game that isn't turn-based.
