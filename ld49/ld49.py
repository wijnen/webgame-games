<p>Welcome to Magicium, stranger. My name is Activius and I am the protector of this town.<br/>
Unfortunately, Magicium is in grave danger. You see, the town was built on many
wooden poles. This used to work very well for us, but with time the structures
have begun to degrade.</p>

<p>Luckily, Radionius, who was our town's protector three centuries ago, had
expected that this would happen. And so he prepared a system to fix everything.
It's brilliant! We just need to pull a handle and the entire town will be
fortified and ready to withstand another thousand years!</p>

<p class="you">Do you want me to help? Just tell me what to do.</p>

<p>Do you see that gate? We need to open it. To do that, you need to insert a
specific isotope. Here is a container in which you can store one isotope. Use
it to carry the isotope to the gate and open it. Click on the container to use
it on the gate. That will only work if it is the correct isotope.</p>

<p>And do you see those three machines over there? You can use them to get
isotopes. Only one of them gives you the isotope you need for this gate, so
choose carefully. Although it's not a problem if you make a mistake; when you
get another one, it will replace whatever was in the container.</p>

<p class="you">Isotope? What is that? Can you explain what I'm doing here?</p>

<p>Of course. But let's take a step back. Whenever you enter a room, I will
tell you some things about our town. But there are also puzzles you need to
solve. If you need help with those puzzles, talk to me for an explanation about
it.</p>

<p>This is all about nuclear physics. In chemistry they talk abuot atoms. But
there are really several different particles which are all called the same
atom. For example, when they talk about hydrogen, you know it contains exactly
one proton, but you don't know anything about the number of neutrons. An
isotope is just an atom where you know not only the number of protons, but also
the number of neutrons it contains.</p>

<p>An isotope consists of a nucleus, which is made
up of protons and neutrons. There are also electrons somewhere around it, but
we don't care about them. Now to write down an isotope, you will need to write
two numbers, followed by a symbol. The first number is above the second and it
is the total number of particles in the isotope, so the protons plus the
neutrons. The number below that is the electrical charge of the isotope, so
that's the number of protons. After all, protons have a charge of +1 and the
neutrons have no charge. The symbol that comes after it, is the chemical element
that the isotope is. That is defined by the number of protons, so if you know
that, you have not only the bottom number, but also the symbol. Well, if you
know which symbol corresponds to which number, anyway.</p>

<p class="you">Can you give me that table?</p>

<p>Of course. In this game, we only use the first 20 elements, so I'll give you
those. You may want to write them down somewhere, because you will need them
throughout the game. You can also still find it when you click on me, but that
may get tiresome. Also, you can also find them in text books and on the
internet.  Just search for "periodic table".</p>

<p>Well done! Now we get to the next gate. Which is also harder to open.</p>

<p class="you">So why are these doors here in the first place? Didn't Radionius
want you to pull the handle when you needed to?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it's not that simple. The system should not be activated
before it was needed. Because of that, Radionius has added these secure gates
to protect it. Only wise people should be able to open them. And he had a weird
sense of humor, so he decided to make locks that were themselves based on
instability: radioactive isotopes.</p>
''')
alpha_theory = _('''\
<p>The machines with an alpha symbol (Î±) on them are special. They will give you
an isotope, but there are two special things happening. First of all, you need
to give it an isotope as well. So as long as you don't carry any isotopes, you
cannot use those machines. But you can check what they offer.</p>

<p>The second issue is that during the transaction, the isotopes will emit
alpha radiation. When that happens, they change. So you need ot give the
machine something that will become what it requests after the decay.</p>

<p class="you">What happens to an isotope when it emits an alpha particle?</p>

<p>The alpha particle consists of two protons and two neutrons. So it's a
helium nucleus. But because it is so common for these particles to be emitted
from nuclear reactions, they have earned a special name. That's why we call
them alpha particles.</p>

<p>So what happens to the isotope? Simple: it loses two protons and two
neutrons. So its mass decreases by four and its atomic number by two. Because
the number of protons changes, it also becomes a different element. So the
symbol also changes.</p>

<p>Now if I may talk to the player for a moment,</p>

<p class="you">Who?</p>

<p>You can ignore me; the player understands it.</p>

<p>Hello. Thank you for playing this game. Hopefully it teaches you some things
about nuclear physics. While making this game, I have tried to use actual
physical processes as much as possible. So what you learn here is also what
happens in the real world, and it is also what they teach in school. However,
there is one important exception: the isotopes that are presented may not
always exist in reality. And more importantly, the decays that are happening in
the game may not happen in those isotopes even if they do exist. In particular,
none of the isotopes that we are using emit alpha radiation in reality. That is
something that only heavier atoms do. I chose to use them anyway, for two
reasons: first, you will learn their names, symbols and atomic numbers by
playing this game. That is more useful for the "lower" elements. Second, those
elements are much more well known. I didn't want you to need to learn about new
elements; there's enough to learn here already.</p>

<p>Thanks for your attention, you can go back to playing now.</p>

<p class="you">What was that about? There's nobody else here. You are
weird...</p>

# Beta minus {{{

<p class="you">But aren't you wise enough to open these gates? Were the
expectations of Radionius too high?</p>

<p>Oh no, that is not a problem. I know how to do it. But I'm old, and my hands
don't obey me as well as they used to. So I need someone else to open the gates
for me.</p>

<p class="you">But you're only giving me cryptic hints about what to do!
Why don't you just tell me how to configure to bux, and which machines I should
use?</p>

<p>Ah yes, I suppose I could do that. But I'm afraid I have inherited some of
the peculiar habits of Radionius. I enjoy it much more to watch you solve these
puzzles than to tell you the answer.</p>

<p class="you">Now here are machines that have a beta on them, what are they?</p>

<p>You need to pay more attention to details! It's not just a beta, there also
is a minus sign. We pronounce that as "beta minus".</p>

<p class="you">Alright, sorry about that. So it's beta minus. But my question
remains: what are they?</p>

<p>They are similar the the alpha machines, but they use beta minus decay. That
means that a neutron in converted into a proton and an electron. The proton
remains in the nucleus, but the electron is ejected at high speed. That is the
radiation that can be detected. Because the electrons that make up the
radiation are negatively charged, it's called beta minus.</p>

<p class="you">Does beta plus also exist?</p>

<p>Ah, you are curious. Very good! Yes, it does also exist. But I will not
explain to you what it is until you reach the next room.</p>

<p class="you">You are so mean! Then at least tell me what beta minus decay
does to the isotope.</p>

<p>Why don't you think of it yourself? What do you think would happen?</p>

<p class="you">Well, let's see. A neutron becomes a proton. So the mass doesn't
change, but it gains one charge. And that makes sense, because we lose the
electron which has a negative charge. So losing -1 means gaining +1.</p>

<p>Very good! Now let's open that door!</p>

<p>You have arrived at the last simple room. After this, it becomes complex.</p>

<p class="you">You called this simple? I thought it was pretty hard!</p>

<p>Yes, but that's because you had to learn all those things. Once you know them, it's simple.</p>

<p class="you">So why is the next room more complex?</p>

<p>Well, it's easier in terms of learning. There aren't any new reactions after
this. But so far, every room has just had you use a single reaction. In the
rooms after this, you will need to combine several reactions to open the
door.</p>

<p class="you">But it's only machines that I have already seen?</p>

<p>Beta plus is just like beta minus, except it's not a neutron that turns into
a proton, but a proton that turns into a neutron. In that reaction, there is
also another particle created, called a positron. It's very similar to an
electron, but it has a charge of +1.</p>

<p>Because those positrons are ejected and can be detected, this radiation (and
this decay) is called beta plus.</p>

<p>A lot more can be said about positrons. If you want to know, you should
search the internet. I'm not explaining ie here, because you don't need it to
open the gates.</p>

<p>Summarizing: when there is beta decay, a proton is converted into a neutron
(and a positron, but that is ejected), so the isotope loses 1 charge, but keeps
the same mass.</p>
